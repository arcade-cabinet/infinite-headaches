# Homestead Headaches

## Game Manual

### Overview
**Homestead Headaches** is a 3D stacking game where you save farm animals from an incoming storm! Drag your base animal to catch falling friends, build a tower to the sky, and "bank" them in the barn before the wind blows them away.

## Core Gameplay

### Controls
- **Drag (Mouse/Touch):** Move your base animal left/right to catch falling animals.
- **Tap Stack:** Poke an animal to trigger a reaction (or special ability!).
- **Bank Button:** Appears when you stack 5+ animals. Tap to save them!

### The Goal
1.  **Catch:** Don't let animals hit the ground.
2.  **Stack:** Build as high as you can.
3.  **Balance:** Manage the "Wobble." Moving too fast or landing off-center makes the stack unstable.
4.  **Bank:** Secure your points by banking stacks of 5 or more.

## Mechanics

### Wobble Physics
Your stack is physics-based!
- **Momentum:** Moving quickly adds momentum to the stack.
- **Impact:** Catching an animal off-center causes the stack to lean.
- **Danger:** If the stack leans too far (turns red), it will topple!

### The Storm (AI Director)
The game is watched by an AI Director that adjusts difficulty based on your skill:
- **Mercy:** If you're struggling, it might slow down or give you a power-up.
- **Challenge:** If you're playing perfectly, expect wind gusts and faster drops!

## Power-Ups

Catch these falling items to help your farm:
- **Rare Candy (Pink):** Merges your stack into one "Mega Animal" (more stable!).
- **Potion (Purple):** Heals 1 Heart.
- **Great Ball (Blue):** Magnetizes your stack, pulling animals toward it.
- **X Attack (Orange):** Double points for a short time.

## Scoring
- **Catch:** Base points based on height.
- **Perfect Catch:** Center alignment = 2.5x Points + "Perfect" Sparkles.
- **Bank:** Secure points + Earn "Bank Bonus".
- **Lives:** You have 3 Hearts. Dropping an animal or toppling loses a heart.
